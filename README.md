# SimpleShooter
A simple over-the-shoulder third-person shooter game I created as an exercise to practice C++ and to explore different methods of handling enemy AI, from sequentially coding logic with C++ to playing around with behaviour trees and blackboards in UE. Settled on the behaviour trees in the end as it was new to me and I was interested in its potential. I'm not generally a huge fan of shooter games but created this one as it is fairly simple mechanically and facilitated quick iterations of different enemy behaviours. Everything was done in C++ with minimal to no blueprints used.
